Maybe I’m sleepy and the sceptic in me is far asleep but I’ve really believed
that someone has finally did it, finally a video capturing app with beautiful
filters that will make my shitty videos look hip and *instavideofied*.

So I’m looking at [Telly](http://telly.com), thinking to myself I need to be installing
this  right now – so I did.

I need to give one thing to these guys, they really know how to present a product.
A mediocore product with yet another set of cheesy filters.

This kind of things makes me wonder if the platform itself is preventing developers from creating
a fantastic app which adds some really nice looking filters to the video? Or is it
just a lack know-how?
