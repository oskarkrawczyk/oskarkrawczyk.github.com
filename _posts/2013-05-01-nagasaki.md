It seems I’ve been a bit too ignorant about [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com),
thinking most artists there are far from being serious musicians. A few days ago this
gem popped up somewhere on Reddit, decided to have a peek, and really wasn’t dissapointed.

This **mashup of Japanese folk and glitch-hop** has been looping in my player for the past four days.

(Be sure to play this on large speakrs not your laptop)

Because of this, I’ve started browsing through SoundClound and as it
turns out there are many, many more gems hidden.
