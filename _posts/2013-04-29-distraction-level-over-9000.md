How distracted are you while reading this?

If you’re like the past-me, you’re getting mail notifications popping on the screen,
Facebook alerts and Tweets pinging you to look at your phone,
icons changing to light blue in your menubar, oh, and the Dock badges, the insane-red dock badges.

How about I tell you all of the aforementioned is <strong>cutting your productivity by half</strong>.

If you work in IT, and I assume you are, you work 8 hours, which is not really 8 hours
because there are very few people who can actually be productive for this long when sitting in front of a computer.
I’m going to say, that on your best day, <strong>you work the absolute maximum of 5 hours,
and those are cut in half because of distraction</strong> – pretty close to Tim Ferriss’, The 4-hour Workweek.

The distraction all around you is not only making your unproductive, it affects your body, and mind. In the long
run you’ll destroy your ability to focus for long periods of time, this will lead to problems with memory, and this
will cause other problems with your body.

The times we live in don’t make keeping your focus any easier. It’ll only get more difficult, so you need to start keeping the distraction level to the minimum.

Here are the things I did, and believe me, this helps a lot:

1. **Turn off automatic mail downloading**. Check it twice, three time a day. Unless you’re a freelance surgeon, you don’t need to reply to email straight away. Believe me, nothing will happen if you do it three times a day, no one will die.
2. **Out with Twitter/Facebook notifications**. I’m not saying you can’t check it every now and again, but there’s no need for in-your-face notifications.
3. **Mute your phone**. My phone is always on mute. Knowing how things work, you’ll always get a phone call when your in your productivity-peak, and the thing with this is that, once you loose your focus, it’s hard to get it back. There are obviously exceptions to this advice, mostly when I’m expecting a call that needs to be answered.
4. **Out wit the menubar/Dock notifications**. I’m not crazy, I keep most apps that can potentially steal your focus, open (Reeder, Flint, Messages). But I always turn badges off. The little red circle is very well designed to steal focus.

You can kid yourself, that you’re always in perfect focus, but how about giving the
things above a try for two weeks. I’ll buy you a coffee if you decide to go back after that time.
