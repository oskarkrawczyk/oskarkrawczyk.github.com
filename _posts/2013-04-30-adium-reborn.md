Can you believe there are only two worthy chat applications for the Mac? First provided by Apple, and
successfully degrading in quality. Second, Adium, developed by the Open Source community.

The former, Messages, looks great but is just a ridiculous bug–fest. Hardly anything works as it should. The latter,
works fantastic, but looks like it just DeLorean-time-jumped from the early 2000’s.

Taking all of the above in account, and you get a lovely space in the market.
[Dawid Liberadzki](http://dribbble.com/liberadzki) and I decided to create a case
where we modify how Adium looks, below is the result (click to see the full presentation).

Most of the screens from the presentation are self–explanatory. One thing that might
need some introduction is the Active Input, this is basically something like Fantastical
has – an intelligent input that figures out the stuff you’re trying to do, like:

- **chat** Robert
- **chat** Robert **and** Luke
- **message** Robert
- **yesterdays chat** with Robert
- Robert **history** from **yesterday**
- **status** away
- **add** oskar.krawczyk@gmail.com to **Friends**
- ...

As you can imagine, the possiblities are pretty much endless.

Now, who wants to fork Adium or start from scratch and make this UI happen?
