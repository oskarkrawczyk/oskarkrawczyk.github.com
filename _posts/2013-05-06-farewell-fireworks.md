Today Adobe decided to [stop any further development of Fireworks](http://blogs.adobe.com/fireworks/2013/05/the-future-of-adobe-fireworks.html).

This is very sad news for Fireworks and me, well that was a heck of a love story (since Macromedia Fireworks MX).
Sure, the software wasn’t perfect, especially since Adobe acquired it, but it was still the best out there.

I was never able to understand how Photoshop works, I really tried but most the way it works is illogical to me,
for instance Redo/Undo, or how difficult it is to change a shape, or sometimes even drag it. Not even
mentioning the painful slowness of Photoshop and the fact that the same file in Photoshop will weight 100 MB,
and 2 MB in Fireworks (I have no idea how’s that possible).

Taking all of this in account, it’s interesting that Adobe’s reasoning behind killing-off Fireworks is "Over the last couple of years, there has been an increasing amount of overlap
in the functionality between Fireworks and both existing and new programs like Photoshop, Illustrator,
and Edge Reflow [...]". Ok, but I use neither, and I don’t want to use more than a single app.

So no, this wasn’t the case, the reason is the usual, Fireworks was not profitable - this I understand,
it’s business, **Adobe is not in the business of making us happy, but making money**.

So there you have it, I might say this is an end of the era for me as a designer, I’m not going to learn
Photoshop, I’ll probably stick around with Fireworks until it just stops working because of OS X incompatibility.

Mahalo.
